# Flightmare 

**Flightmare** is a flexible modular quadrotor simulator.
Flightmare is composed of two main components: a configurable rendering engine built on Unity and a flexible physics engine for dynamics simulation.
Those two components are totally decoupled and can run independently from each other. 
Flightmare comes with several desirable features: (i) a large multi-modal sensor suite, including an interface to extract the 3D point-cloud of the scene; (ii) an API for reinforcement learning which can simulate hundreds of quadrotors in parallel; and (iii) an integration with a virtual-reality headset for interaction with the simulated environment.
Flightmare can be used for various applications, including path-planning, reinforcement learning, visual-inertial odometry, deep learning, human-robot interaction, etc.
